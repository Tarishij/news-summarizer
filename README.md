# Extractive Multi document News summarizer using BERT
In this final year B.Tech project we attempt to perform multi document summarisation via new model implemented by Google in 2018 as a solution for various NLP problems: BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), for extractive multi document summarization .BERT model is combined with unsupervised summarisation approach of k-means model of clustering , centroid-based model through compositionality of BERT embeddings, MMR and then finally ordering sentences chosen for the summary. Our method gave fairly good results when evaluated on ROUGE using DUC2002 dataset.
